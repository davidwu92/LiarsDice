We'll deploy on TWO sites.

~~~~Backend/Server Folder is deployed to HEROKU.~~~~
1. Create a new app on Heroku. Call it liars-dice-app.
2. Make sure cors is required and used in server/index.js:
    line 5: const cors = require('cors')
    line 71: app.use(cors())
3. In the terminal, in SERVER directory...
  heroku login (log in through browser)
  git init (we already did)
  heroku git:remote -a liars-dice-app
  
4. Make sure server directory has .gitignore (with /node_modules) and a Procfile (web: node index.js)
    THEN make sure to change the server's package.json script: "start": "node index.js" (instead of nodemon)

5. Back to terminal:
  git add .
  git commit -am "commit message"
  git push heroku master

6. Now that SERVER is deployed, COPY that url because we'll need it when deploying the front end.
    https://liars-dice-app.herokuapp.com/


~~~~Frontend/Client Folder is deployed to NETLIFY.~~~~

1. Go to Chat.js and change the ENDPOINT to that url (instead of `localhost:5000`)

2. Log into Netlify. Right click Client, Reveal in File Explorer. DRAG AND DROP CLIENT FOLDER into the Netlify space.

3. Install Netlify CLI globally: npm i netlify-cli -g

4. Terminal: in CLIENT directory...
    netlify login
    netlify deploy. It'll ask some questions; we DON'T need a site name.
        ~~IMPORTANT~~
        Netlify will ask for a Publish Directory, which we wanna do from a build. so Cntrl C to get out.

5. Terminal: in CLIENT directory,
    npm run build
        (Once the build folder is generated, we can tell Netlify we want to publish THAT build.)
    netlify deploy
    ?Publish directory: ./build

6. Now we're done. Live Draft URL will be where our front-end is hosted.
